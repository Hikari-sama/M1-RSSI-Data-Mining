# M1-RSSI-Data-Mining: Model Evaluation & Robustness on Diabetes Diagnosis

This repository contains a technical study on the impact of evaluation methodologies on predictive models for diabetes diagnosis using **Weka**.

> 📄 **Note:** The summary below is in English, but the full detailed report (PDF) and analysis are written in **French**.

## 📂 Project Overview
The objective is to validate model performance beyond internal training data, ensuring the algorithms can generalize to unseen patient profiles.
Dataset: Diabetes.arff (768 instances, 8 clinical attributes, 1 binary target).
Tools: Weka 3.8.
Algorithms Evaluated: OneR, J48 (C4.5), Naive Bayes, and IBk (KNN).
